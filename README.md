<H1>Testing Document Base Template</H1>
<p>In my organisation while I was learning testing techniques I saw my collegues and seniors in this domain make testing documentation for particular tickets in form of Word Document which involves few basic fields like Test Case Scenario, Test Case, Additional Validations and Cross Platform Validation, The process of creating document everytime seemed hectic to me and thus thought of creating a base template that shall bring little ease to the process.<br>
As am trying to gain some knowledge in python I created the same using Python libraries. Tkinter library for handling the GUI and docx for handdling and creating the document. The logic behind the code is very simple : <br>
We take first input as Number of Test Case Scenario and then on basis of each scenario we take input of Number of Test Cases.<br>
In the document we add the number of scenarios and test cases along general fields that will be same for each document.</p>
